This is a basic C# and .NET project that uses SignalR and JavaScript to create a simple real-time chat application. The app has two main parts:

   - A list of connected users.
   - Two text boxes:
     - One to type a message you want to send.
     - One to enter the ID of the user you want to send the message to.
   - Below these, you'll see a list of messages showing who sent them and who they were sent to.

## Technologies Used
